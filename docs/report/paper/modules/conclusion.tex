\section{Conclusions}
Starting from the fact that I did not expect too high performances a $76\%$ AUC is not too bad, unfortunately I did not found notebooks or any other data to compare my results with.
I was surprised of how a 3-degree polynomial model overfits and the linear is better than it.
\subsection{Future works}
It could be possible to implement a classifier that predicts both valence and arousal, it could be done with a SVM multiclass classifier that uses softmax regression or with two binary SVMs.
